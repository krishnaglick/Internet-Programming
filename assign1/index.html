				About Me
			</font>
			<p>
				My name is Krishna Glick. That's Indian, as in the subcontinent, not the fucking scrubs who were owned by the white man.
				<br><br>
				My parents are Jewish by ancestry but converted to Hinduism which is why I have my name. I was born and raised for a while in Miami, but then moved to this quaint as fuck little town named Alachua which is just north of bum fuck nowhere, I mean Gainesville.
				<br><br>
				Currently I'm wasting my time writing this shit for this dumbass class which will be easy as fuck cause I currently #SWAG IT UP AT A REAL FUCKING WEB DEV JOB YOU FUCKING RETARD TEACHER!
				<br><br>
				I get paid baller money as well, probably almost as well as you do WHILE STILL IN SCHOOL. THAT'S HOW FUCKING GOOD I AM BITCH.
				<br><br>
				In the future I will make more money and you still will be a scrub.
