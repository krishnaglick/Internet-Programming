					About Me
				</h3>
				<p>
					My name is Krishna Glick. While the name is Indian, I am not.
					<br><br>
					My parents were born Jewish but converted to Hinduism in their mid twenties. They've been vegetarians ever since, and raised myself and my sister in that environment.
					<br><br>
					At present, I'm working towards a degree in Information Systems and am expecting to graduate in Spring on 2016. While I only have a handful of credits left to complete, Information Systems requires two sequential capstone courses which forces me into an extra semester.
					<br><br>
					Additionally, I am employed by a company in downtown Jacksonville called Ascentis. Formerly Starfield, we were recently purchased and are growing exponentially. I am employed as a Software Engineer and spend my time working with our .NET application. We are a small company and my experience with newer front end technologies has put me at the forefront of our integration efforts with Ascentis at large.
					<br><br>
					I hope to maintain my position at Ascentis throughout my schooling, and continue there for some time after graduating. While I currently exist as a developer, I seek to move into management at some point which Ascentis may or may not be able to provide. Regardless, the experience I gather there will help me in my career.
