		Additionally, I am employed by a company in downtown Jacksonville called Ascentis. Formerly Starfield, we were recently purchased and are growing exponentially. I am employed as a Software Engineer and spend my time working with our .NET application.

		I hope to maintain my position at Ascentis throughout my schooling, and continue there for some time after graduating. While I currently exist as a developer, I seek to move into management at some point which Ascentis may or may not be able to provide. Regardless, the experience I gather there will help me in my career.
